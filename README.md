# DIST
Generate atomic structures for common defects in materials

One of the very powerful aspect is the colorful examples. Before you start to use the toolkit, please first check if the examples include the structures that you want. For examples, we already have:
(1) the {111}<11-2>/6 edge dislocation for fcc;
(2) the <111> screw dislocation for bcc;
(3) the magic angle bilayer graphene (1.1);
....

If you cannot find the structures that meets your requirements, you can follow the howto.dat file in the example folders to creat them by yourself.

This is the first part of the DIST toolkit. The second part is about multi-scale modeling of dislocations and strains. This part will be online soon.
