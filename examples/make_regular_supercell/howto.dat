prepare tilt supercell bcc_tilt and the orthogonal coordinate, run 
-------------------
../../coordinate-orthogonalize.py bcc_tilt new_coord > bcc_orth
-------------------
the number 0 - use direct coordinate for output
           1 - use cartesian coodinate for output
if there is no number 0 or 1, the defaut coodinate is cartesian.
The tilt supercell usually needs to be magnified to make sure it's able to
be orthogonized.
