prepare input structure file and the exchange coordinate new_coord, run
-------------------------
../../coordinate-transformation.py before.dat new_coord > after.dat
-------------------------
In after.dat, the structure use new_coord as the coordinate. When making a screw
dislocation, we often need to put the direction of Burgers vector as the 3rd
primitive vector.
