prepare the rotation matrix and the initial supercell, run
----------------------------
../../coordinate-rotation.py before.dat rotate_90_001 > after.dat
----------------------------
the rotation matrix rotates the supercell along [001] by pi/2.
The rotation matrix should be a unit matrix that does not change
the length of the primitive vector and their relative directions
but only rigidly rotates all the atomic position as a whole.
